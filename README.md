# obesity-income
In this project, I explored the relationship between state obesity prevalence and median household income in the United States. Data is from 2022.
I first identified some trends in the data using MySQL. My code can be found in obesity-income.sql and the generated queries are in the queries folder.
Then, I made a few visualizations in Tableau to highlight the correlation between obesity prevalence and median household income. My [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/66XYBF2QB?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) is posted on Tableau Public.
